# Film-Poster-Genre-Classification

Updates:
1. Switch to OOP - each film will be an instance of the class w/ the attributes being the data associated with each film + getter and setter methods to retrieve the data. Then place the object instance into a list. From there, when I need to apply a function, loop through the list and call each method on each instance of the class.

2. Use stratefied sampling to build my training dataset - does that improve the accuracy by reducing the bias in the model?
